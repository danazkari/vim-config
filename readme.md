# Personal subjective VIM config

This is my personal vim config. If this helps anyone else, then awesome!

In order for this to work, you need the right font, use [Patched Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for that.

## Usage

```bash
$ cd && git clone https://github.com/danazkari/vim-config
$ # After this is done, make symbolic links
$ ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/vim-config/.vimrc
$ ln -s ~/.vim ~/vim-config/.vim
```

After that's done, open up `vim` (will sort of fail at first but just continue) and type `:PluginInstall`, this will install all of the plugins.

Close vim and then enter it again, it should look pretty rad.

That's it, go for a cup of coffee and hack hack hackity hack McHack.
